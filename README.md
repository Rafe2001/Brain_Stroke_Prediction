# Brain Stroke Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a person experiencing a brain stroke using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals who are at high risk of having a stroke. In addition, the project includes a web application built with Streamlit for easy visualization and interaction with the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from [source link]. It consists of various demographic, health-related, and lifestyle attributes of patients, along with an indication of whether or not they have experienced a stroke. This dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating the stroke prediction model.

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset file `stroke_data.csv`, which is used as input for the project.
- **notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
- **app.py**: This is the main Python file that contains the Streamlit web application code.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and instructions for usage.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the project dependencies.
- **.streamlit**: This directory contains the Streamlit configuration file `config.toml` for customizing the application's behavior.
